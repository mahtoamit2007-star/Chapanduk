ðŸš€ amit: A Foundational Decentralized Registry (Beginner Solidity)

This project introduces amit, a simple, foundational smart contract designed to help beginners understand how to store basic data on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It serves as the starting block for building any decentralized system by creating a transparent, immutable registry of users.

ðŸ’¡ Project Description
The goal of the amit contract is to create a secure, tamper-proof list of user addresses (wallets) that have interacted with the system. In a decentralized application (DApp), a registry like this is often the first layer, used for tasks such as tracking members, granting early access, or managing permissions.
âœ¨ What It Does
The amit smart contract maintains a single, permanent list on the blockchain:
User Registration: Any wallet can call the registerUser function to add its address to the contract's internal list.
Immutability: Once an address is added, it is permanently recorded and visible to everyone.
Read-Only Access: The contract provides public methods to safely check the total number of registered users and inspect the address at any index.

How to Get Started
Copy the Code: Copy the Solidity code above.
Use Remix: Open the Remix IDE.
Compile: Paste the code, select the correct compiler version (^0.8.0), and compile the contract.

Deploy: Deploy the contract using an injected web3 provider (like MetaMask) on a test network like Celo Sepolia or Sepolia.

Test: Interact with the registerUser() function using a few different accounts to see how the registeredUsers array grows.# Chapanduk
